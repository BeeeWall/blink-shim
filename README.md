# Blink tag shim
A compatibility shim for the long-dead blink tag. I wouldn't recommend actually using this, except for some sort of prank or something. 
## Usage
The syntax is similar to any other text tag in HTML, but this one blinks!
```html
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/PorygonZRocks/blink-shim/82cf663c/blink-shim.js"></script>
<blink>This text blinks!</blink>
```
Result:
<script type="text/javasccript" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/PorygonZRocks/blink-shim/82cf663c/blink-shim.js"></script>
<blink>This text blinks!</blink>
